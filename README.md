## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is the client that wanted to modernize their financial systems. They offer individualized financial plans for their customers. These plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial has a RESTful API. They are seeking our help with how to protect the organization from external threats.


## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I found I was able to lay out any insecure libraries that the company was using well. It is important to code securely because there is often tons of Personal Identifying Information that these companies have, that would be devestating if it got out. Having good software security builds trust within the company knowing that their users data is safe.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Initially the most challenging part of the vulnerability assesment was setting it up in eclipse. After some trial and error, I finally got it to work and was able to procede with the assignments.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
We increased layers of security by adding encryption between the server and user. I specifically added AES-128 bit encryption. In the future, I would ude more vulnerability reports and decide how much to secure the code depending on what the code contains.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made sure the software application was functional and secure by making sure it compiled after each iteration, and secure by checking the encruption in a web browser. I ran a vulnerability report before and after to check if I added any new vulnerabilities.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I think java's documentation about encryption helped me the most. Going back to it in the future will prove worthwile for code security.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show my employer my ability to interpret the client's needs from this project, as I feel like I did a good job identifying them.
